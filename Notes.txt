[FUNCTIONS]
    Methods are functions attached to objects. JS has several built-in.

    Function Syntax
    Ex. function myFunction() {
            alert("hello");         //Declared
        }
        myFunction()                //Invoked
    Function Parameters - values that need to be given to the function within it's parenthesis, 
        optional depending on the function logic
        *Default parameters which fill-in for missing parameters can be defined with an equal 
            sign and given value*
            Ex. function hello(name = "Chris") {
                    console.log(`Hello ${name}!`);
                }
    Function Arguments - the actual values passed to the function which parameters placehold for
    
    Anonymous Function Syntax   *Often used for such functions that take another function as alert
        parameter, the anonymous function acting as the parameter*
        Ex. (function () {
                alert("hello");
            });
    
    Global Scope - top level outside all functions, thus the variables are available "globally"
    Function Scope - variables defined within a function, inaccessible outside of the function
        *Note, loops & conditionals do not hold scope as functions do, though they look similar*
        *Return function property, decides how the handled values get passed*

    Errors - are JS objects complete with name(type) and a message
        Stack Trace -explains when the error was thrown and in what code it broke
        ReferenceError - thrown when a variable is not defined and/or initialized within scope
        SyntaxError- thrown when the code is not written according to the grammatical rules
        TypeError - thrown when attempting to modify a value that cannot be changed, when 
            attempting to use a value in an inappropriate way, or when an operand or argument 
            passed to a function is incompatible with the type expected by that operator or 
            function
